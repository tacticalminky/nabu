# The Nabu Project

## Intro

The goal of this project is to make a self hosted eReader for reading pdf, epub, and cbz files. The goal is to make this eReader run in a docker container on a linux server so that you can read all your books anyware where you have internet access. The backend will be on C++ with the frontend on JavaScript. I want to use an API and database to retrieve and store metadata for all of the books and collections.
